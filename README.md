# recetas-juan-cristina

This project was made using bootstrap 4.
Please remember to activate npm install in your version control command windows

  The present project is the construction of a recipe’s website with most of the features one would expect to see in any other professional web page. I decided to limit the scope of this project to the basic navigation structure of index, about us, contact and catalog page. Another important remark that I have to refer is that I made the page in Spanish, although the comments inside the html and scss files are in English.
  
  I first made a model of the row structure I wanted to implement on wireframe.cc to have a main idea of what I wanted to accomplished. However, during the implementation many things changed, because of practicality or just because I discovered another feature that I liked better.
  
  I worked at the same time with the html structure and the css because the styled page gave me a better idea of how the content should
be divided and positioned.

  On the index page I wanted to include a carousel showing some pictures of food, in order to save space and to make the page look better I decided to make the header a carousel, so it would show the jumbotron and the other content.
  
  Some of the things that I saw in most of the recipe site was that the recipe catalogs or indexes were to big and complicated and I wanted to make it simple and visually interactive. So, I had to develop several features in order to achieve this:
  
    • I separated the recipes in categories, so the catalog would be more organized. I put breakfasts, bakery, salads, meats, fishes,     pizzas, hamburgers and desserts.
    
    • Include a shorter version on the index page and an exclusive catalog page with a more complete version. That way users will be able to access more easily.
    
    • The index version was made with a pill tab navigation system inside a card. I made the card in order to separate this index menu from the rest of the content and have a styled header. I put icons inside the pills, on for every category, because I wanted them to be short and visual. Inside of nav items I put a list of recipes related with its respective category.
    
    • On the proper catalog page, I decided to go for a column nav pill. Inside the tab content I decided to put image-cards with pictures instead of just a list, this way the page looks better and is more visual.

  In addition to the jumbotron, carousel and nav pills I also used bootstrap libraries for the navigation bar, which I also stuck it to the top of the webpage. A modal for login, the menu collapse button for small screens so the page became mobile interactive. I uploaded font from google and icons from font awesome, to give it the look I pretended. I used the media class for images with text in the index page. I put the catalog and the address on the index page inside of cards because I liked the way they looked and also because I wanted to separate and highlight their content from the rest of the page. I also used the breadcrumb and a form for user´s feedback.
